    "Spotify is one of the world's largest music streaming service providers with over 365 million monthly active users. \n",
    "The Spotify database includes a variety of information on the characteristics and metrics of song tracks. Each song on Spotify is associated with a popularity index ranging from 0 to 100 reflecting how popular a song is relative to other songs. In this project, we plan to apply the analysis techniques that we learned in class to the Spotify music database. The **research question** is how can we predict the popularity of a song using characteristics such as danceability, energy, loudness and artist (descrbed below in the data sources section). We plan to explore different machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees and support vector regression and compare their relative performance on prediction. The scope of the project is feasible since the dataset we will use is readily avaiable online through Kaggle, the dataset contains a variety of songs and variables for analysis and it's in a relatively clean format. The algorithm from our project could  be helpful for the artist community to predict the popularity of new release songs ahead of time and could inform future researches on understanding what factors influence popularity on Spotify.

    "*Your proposal should discuss the data you will use to answer your research questions. Be as specific as possible: name the datasets you will use and how you will access them or specify where you will look for the relevant datasets and why you expect to be successful in finding them. You should also briefly justify why the data you plan to obtain will be relevant and appropriate for addressing your research questions.* \n",

    "The data used for this project comes from an episode of the [Sliced](https://www.notion.so/SLICED-Show-c7bd26356e3a42279e2dfbafb0480073) data science challenge held in summer 2021. The data is accessible publicly on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sliced-s01e08-KJSEks/data), and was initially extracted from the Spotify Web API. The competition provides three datasets, each of which we will make use of to answer our research questions:\n",

    "These data are extremely detailed and rich. The `train` set has 21,000 rows, while the `artists` set has 17,718 rows. Note the ease in which we can join the two together as well, specifically using `id_artists` = `id` to join any of `test/train` with `artists`. No doubt, we will be able to address our research question on how and why a given song is popular/unpopular on Spotify. We may also be able to explore the similarity of songs within artists and across artists based on a number of the features present in their songs (energy, key, loudness, etc.)."
